This inspection reports cases when a light service class that is also marked with one of the <code>Service.Level</code>
types is being retrieved via a <code>ComponentManager</code> (Project or Application) that doesn't match the service
level specified in the class' <code>@Service</code> annotation.
<p>
    Light services that are marked with both <code>Service.Level#PROJECT</code> and <code>Service.Level#APP</code> or
    neither of them, are excluded from the report.
    <code>Module#getService()</code> calls are also excluded since there is no <code>Service.Level</code> enum constant
    for that, and module level services are no more recommended by JetBrains to be used.
