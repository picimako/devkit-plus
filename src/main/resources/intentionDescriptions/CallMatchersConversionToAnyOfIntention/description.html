This intention combines CallMatcher.&lt;matches> calls in selected boolean expressions with 2 or more operands into a
single <code>CallMatcher.anyOf()</code> constant.
<p>
    All matcher methods of <code>CallMatcher</code> are recognized (matches, test, methodMatches,
    methodReferenceMatches, uCallMatches).
